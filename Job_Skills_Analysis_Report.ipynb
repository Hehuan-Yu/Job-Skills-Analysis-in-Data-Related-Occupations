    "### 1.1 Project Objective <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"sec_1.1\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "This project extract, clean, explore and analyze job description data of three popular job titles -- Data Analyst, Data Engineer and Data Scientist, in recent couple of months from SEEK website. This GitHub repo contains all the codes and datasets for this project. The objectives of this project are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clean dirty datetime data, then transform them for analytics.**\n",
    "- **Exploratory data analysis**, e.g.\n",
    "  - find the hottest technical and soft skills for different job titles -- Data Analyst, Data Engineer and Data Scientist.\n",
    "  - analyze the salary differences for different job titles and job types.\n",
    "  - analyze the available positions and required technical skills in different regions.\n",
    "  - analyze the possible relationship between salary range and required technical skills.\n",
    "**Provide career path references for people who would like to be a Data Analyst, Data Engineer or Data Scientist.**\n",

    "### 1.3 Project Assumption  <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"sec_1.3\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assuming that the SEEK website can represent the current situation and trends of job market in Australia.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assuming the recruitment data on the SEEK website is accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assume that people always would like to put the most important information first, for example, the higher the position in the job advertisement. In other words, the earlier the relevant skills appear means that they are more important to the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Key Insights  <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"sec_1.4\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "This project extract job description data of three popular job titles -- Data Analyst, Data Engineer and Data Scientist,\n",
    "in recent couple of months from SEEK website. The job locations include eight major cities in Australia – Sydney,\n",
    "Melbourne, Perth, Brisbane, Gold Coast, Adelaide, ACT and Hobart. Among them, there are 2224 job advertisements\n",
    "for Data Analyst, 1180 job advertisements for Data Engineer, and 529 job advertisements for Data Scientist. From the\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Data Cleaning - How to Use Regular Expression to Clean the Job Salary and Job Ad Posted Time? <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"sec_2.1\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we did not analyze the job salary because the data was not plenty enough for the moment. This\n",
    "project focuses more on the analysis of required skills.\n",
    "Moreover, if we have enough recruitment data for several years, we can also analyze the trend of the data job\n",
    "market, for example, how the hottest required skills change over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.1 Job Salary Data Cleaning <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"sec_2.1.1\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, we use Regular Expression to extract the salary data and transform them into float numbers from the\n",
    "database.\n",
    "Then, based on different salary range, the job salary can be divided into following three categories:\n",
    "* If salary is lower than 200, it is paid by per hour;\n",
    "* If salary is greater than 200 and lower than 2000, it is paid by per day;\n",
    "* If salary is greater than 2000, it is paid by per annual.\n",
    "\n",
    "In such way, the annual salary can be calculated according to the full-time working hours from Australian\n",
    "government website. There are 251 working days or 2008 working hours per year for a full-time working position.\n",
    "Finally, the data can be converted into a CSV file and needs to be manually checked for errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1.2 Job Ad Posted Time Data Cleaning <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"sec_2.1.2\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The job Ad posted time usually have the following suffixes:\n",
    "* ‘m’ means the job ad was posted minutes ago;\n",
    "* ‘h’ means the job ad was posted hours before;\n",
    "* ‘d’ means the job ad was posted days ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these suffixes, we can use the Python datetime library to calculate the Universal Time Coordinated\n",
    "date of the job ad posted time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Dimensional Modeling Method – How to Model and Transform the Data into Job Details Fact table and Job Info Dimension Table? <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"sec_2.2\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, the dimensional data modelling technique will be applied to construct the data warehouse which\n",
    "could store and retrieve data quickly for the further analysis (Saxena & Agarwal, 2014). By applying the DDM in this project, the data\n",
    "behavior and domain can be easily understood, and their performance can be optimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2.1 Identifying Business Objective <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"sec_2.2.1\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the data we have collected, the business objective is to identify the required skills in various job\n",
    "position for the people who would like establish their career in the field of data. Therefore, the key words\n",
    "regarding skills will be extracted and analyzed from the job details.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2.2 Identifying Granularity <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"sec_2.2.2\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Granularity is the lowest level of information for the tables in the data warehouse. The grain will be used for\n",
    "identifying the level of details for the business problem. Hence, the grain of fact table are job_id, section_id, and\n",
    "line_id which can be used to identify each job details. The grain of dimensional table is job_id which could be\n",
    "used to identify job information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2.3 Identifying Dimensions <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"sec_2.2.3\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensions are used for categorizing and describing facts and measures. The job information of each job can be\n",
    "classified as the dimensions in this project. The dimensional table is used for storing the descriptive data and\n",
    "providing the context to the fact creation. In this case, the Job Info Dimensional Table contains all the\n",
    "dimensions of each job such as the job title, job company, job area, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2.4 Identifying Facts <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"sec_2.2.4\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the aim of this project is to investigate the job skills that are required for each position. The fact refers to\n",
    "each job details that is posted as well as the fact table is utilized for storing a collection of measures such as\n",
    "section id, line id, job details, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2.5 Building the schema <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"sec_2.2.5\"></a>\n",

    "\n",
    "The search algorithm from SEEK website brings up lots of irrelevant job titles, such as business intelligence,\n",
    "accountant, etc. Therefore, before further analysis, we need to filter out the related recruitment data for Data\n",
    "Analyst, Data Engineer, Data Scientist. In this project, we can use SQL LIKE and UNLIKE operator to identify\n",
    "whether if the job title belongs to these three titles or not.\n",

    "including technical and soft skills. Then through the word cloud we can see which technologies are more\n",
    "important than others. We can also use SQL LIKE operator to identify which statements contain these keywords\n",
